# Repository documentation and information

The documentation in this section will be separated in two files:

- Notebooks.md: It will contain documentation for notebooks that do not contain an adequate explanation within them.
- SourceCode.md: It will contain the documentation of the code
- Thinking.md: It will contain the thinking flow of the code, in order to continue the elaboration 
after the end of the work.
